# PRIZM 4.0

A DSTA design system. Serves two product families — command-and-control (C3) and enterprise. Built on Base UI and Tailwind CSS. Engineered for developers and AI.

## What's in the box

- **44 component primitives** (all stable) — shared by both product families
- **Four theme variants** — `c3-light`, `c3-dark`, `enterprise-light`, `enterprise-dark`
- **A docs site** at `/` that doubles as the public component browser. Top-level nav: Overview (Introduction, Getting started, Using with AI, Installation, Theming, Air-gap setup, Changelog) → Foundations → Components → C3 → Enterprise.
- **An LLM layer** — `PRIZM.md`, `llms.txt`, per-component context files in `/llms/`
- **Air-gap support** — self-hosted fonts, no CDN refs, offline release artifacts
- **Copy-paste distribution** — own your components, no npm package required

## Running locally

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

Before running, drop self-hosted font files into `public/fonts/` — see `public/fonts/README.md` for sources.

## Scripts

| Script | What it does |
|--------|--------------|
| `pnpm dev` | Run the docs site in dev mode |
| `pnpm build` | Build the static export to `out/` |
| `pnpm verify` | Run the full CI chain locally — use before pushing |
| `pnpm lint` | Run Biome (lint + format check) |
| `pnpm typecheck` | Run the TypeScript compiler |
| `pnpm build:offline` | Produce release tarballs for air-gapped consumers |

Run `pnpm run` to see the full list, including audits, generation tasks, and CI helpers.

## For AI assistants

Start with [PRIZM.md](./PRIZM.md). It explains conventions, theming, distribution, and what to do when asked to add or modify components.
